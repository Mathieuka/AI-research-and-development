# Research and Development

Welcome to the Research and Development Monorepo! This repository centralizes multiple projects and internal packages, all managed by Turborepo to optimize the development process. This setup enables efficient collaboration, code reuse, and consistent configuration management across projects.

## Overview

This monorepo comprises various applications and shared packages that support the development and integration of AI agents, as well as other foundational projects.

## Project Structure

### Apps

The `apps/` directories are dedicated to developing and integrating AI agents. Each application serves a unique purpose and can be developed independently while sharing common resources through the packages.

- **`apps/WorkPlace`**: A dedicated space to explore, test, and evaluate various AI agents developed from different models, each tailored for unique use cases.

### Packages

The `packages/` directories contain shared modules and configurations that are reused across different applications, ensuring consistency and reducing duplication of effort.

- **`packages/typescript-config`**: Contains the `tsconfig.json` configuration used throughout the monorepo to maintain consistent TypeScript settings.

- **`packages/biome-config`**: Houses the `biome.json` configuration, applied across the monorepo to standardize environment and project settings.
